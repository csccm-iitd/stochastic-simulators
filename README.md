TensorFlow implementation of deep learning-based surrogate model for stochastic simulators. Generative neural network is used to approximate the stochastic response. A simple feed-forward neural network is used with a conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) loss-function. The CMMD allows to capture the discrepancy between the between the true response of the stochastic simulator and the distribution predicted by the neural network.
